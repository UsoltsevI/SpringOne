### My first project using Spring Framework

This is a project for practicing using Spring Framework (+ Maven) without Spring Boot, despite I've use Spring Boot in first commit. 

It would be a simple web application with a lot of features

To compile a project after downloading use following command:
```mvn clean install```
To start an application:
```java -jar ./target/SpringOne-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar```

The section will be finalised later...
