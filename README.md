## My first project using Spring Framework

This is a project for practicing using Spring Framework (+ Maven) without Spring Boot, despite I've use Spring Boot in first commit. 

It would be a simple web application with a lot of Spring features.

### Description of the latest version

In the latest version I've tryed to use Spring Dependency Injection, but it still doesn't work.

### Usage

The command to download this project:
```
git clone git@github.com:UsoltsevI/SpringOne.git
```
To compile the project after downloading use the following command:
```
mvn clean install
```
To launch the application:
```
java -jar ./target/SpringOne-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The section will be finalised later...
